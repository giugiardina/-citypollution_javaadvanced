# City Life Scores - Giuliana Giardina

The purpose is to show the life scores on a chosen city of interest with the use of API <a href="https://developers.teleport.org/api/">Teleport</a>.

##How to use
Type your favourite city in the search bar and click "enter", the city's scores will appear, showing the following information:
- Housing

Pleace, be aware that not all cities will be shown. This doesn't depend on my project, but on the external service used and the material they provide.
